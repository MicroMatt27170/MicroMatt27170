## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Backend Developer at Softalleys, specializing in .NET services, with a strong focus on authentication using OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect. I am passionate about building robust, modern backend solutions and am actively working on the Softalleys/Softalleys.Utilities public repository, which provides essential tools for CQRS Pattern implementation in C#/.NET projects.

As a Windows enthusiast and dedicated Microsoft fan, I enjoy exploring new technologies, including GitHub Copilot, and am always eager to adopt tools that improve productivity and code quality.
